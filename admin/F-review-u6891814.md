### Comments 

<I think Duo Liu did pretty well in isPlacementValid method. I think the best feature of the code is that the code is clear and well structured, I can clearly 
understand each line of the code. First of all, since this method is a task that require us to write, the comment part of the method shows the function of the 
method, and also with clear parameters and return values, in this case, I believe isPlacement Valid is well documented. Second, the isPlacementValid method is
structured appropriate by using static method. Third, the method also follow Java conventions, for example, he names piece position as tempX and tempY, which 
clearly shows what they represent. At last, I believe the method can function well in any situation, Liu has checked whether the placement is well structured by 
using the isPlacementWellFormed method and also checked whether each piece is entirely on the board and whether is is overlaped by other pieces. In conclusion, 
Liu did really great job and we used this method a lot in our later code. >
